# Object Detection w/ YOLO v8
This as an implementation of **Ultralytics YOLO v8** for object detection.
## Introduction
**YOLO v8** is _state of the art_ model from computer vision tasks from **[Ultralytics](https://www.ultralytics.com)**. In this project, I have implemented it for _object detection_ task.
## Features
1. Real time object detection via Webcam
2. Object detection in an uploaded video file
## Technologies Used
1. Ultralytics YOLO v8 (Model)
2. OpenCV (Video Processing)
3. Roboflow Supervision (Video Processing)
4. Streamlit (UI)
